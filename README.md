# AL_demo

This is a short demonstration of different sequential sampling strategies. It includes
1. Random sampling
2. Uncertainty sampling
3. Variance reduction (IMSE: Integrated Mean Squared Error)
4. Maximin distance
5. Querry by Committee
6. Partitioned Active Learning

The user may choose a strategy from above, and see how each strategy behaves with a simple 2D function approximation.
A new sample will be added to the training set and the model will be updated for every hitting enter.
